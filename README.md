# Matlab-Hackathon-Project

Our project involves the simulation of a cruise control system adapted for an electric bicycle with a hub motor attached to the rear wheel. 
The target speed is set by a step function, which causes the system to respond accordingly until the bicycle speed results in no error 
(difference between target speed and current speed).
